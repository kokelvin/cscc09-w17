General Guidelines:
-------------------

1. Your code should be organized as follows:
  * `/` contains all html files
  * `/style/` contains all css files
  * `/media/` contains all images used for the UI
  * `/upload/` contains all images stored in the gallery

2. You should use relative path to reference images, stylesheets, scripts and any other files that are needed by your web application.

3. Your code should be clear and correctly organized. This means no unnecessary repetition of code, correct indentation, good application of conventions, meaningful variable names and comments (as needed).

4. Apply the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). In this assignment, you should structure your HTML and CSS code to avoid unnecessary duplication of code and facilitate its maintenance.

5. You should use exclusively HTML and CSS as covered during the first week of class. This means your code should not use any dynamic feature yet (no javascript and no frontend/backend API).

6. Do not use *out of the box* HTML and CSS sliders.
